# Lab 0: Hello Quantum World!  

This repository contains **Lab 0** of the Qiskit Global Summer School 2025.  
The purpose of this introductory lab is to verify that your environment is set up correctly and to help you become familiar with the lab format.  

---

## Overview  

In this lab, you will:  
- Install and verify Qiskit and the qc-grader package.  
- Configure your IBM Quantum Platform account to access simulators and real hardware.  
- Learn how to use Qiskit Patterns, following the workflow:  
  1. **Map** – Convert a problem into a quantum circuit (create a three-qubit GHZ state).  
  2. **Optimize** – Adapt the circuit for specific hardware constraints.  
  3. **Execute** – Run the circuit on a local simulator using modern primitives.  
  4. **Post-process** – Analyze the results and verify correct state generation.  
- (Bonus) Run the GHZ circuit on a real IBM quantum computer and observe the effects of noise.

## Goal  

By the end of this lab, you will have:  
- Confirmed your software installation and account setup.  
- Understood the lab submission and grading process.  
- Created and analyzed a simple quantum circuit (GHZ state) using Qiskit 2.x.  

This lab sets the foundation for all subsequent exercises in the summer school.
