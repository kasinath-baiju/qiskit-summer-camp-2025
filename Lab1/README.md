# Lab 1: Recreating Famous Experiments at Home!  

This repository contains **Lab 1** of the Qiskit Global Summer School 2025.  
In this lab, we explore fundamental quantum phenomena — **superposition, interference, measurement, and entanglement** — by recreating famous experiments using Qiskit.  

---

## Overview  

In this lab, you will:  
- Review **superposition and interference** through the quantum double-slit experiment.  
- Understand how **measurement collapses quantum states** using Schrödinger’s Cat and a path detector.  
- Explore **entanglement** by implementing the **CHSH game**, showing quantum correlations that surpass classical limits.  
- Implement **quantum teleportation**, transferring quantum information using entanglement and classical communication.  
- (Bonus) Run the teleportation protocol on real IBM Quantum hardware to observe noise effects.

## Key Experiments  

1. **Double-Slit Experiment (Superposition & Interference)**  
   - Create and modify quantum circuits to visualize interference patterns.  
   - See how introducing a path measurement destroys interference fringes.  

2. **Schrödinger’s Cat and Measurement**  
   - Prepare a qubit in superposition and observe how measurement collapses the state.  

3. **Entanglement & the CHSH Game**  
   - Generate Bell states and measure quantum correlations.  
   - Demonstrate quantum strategies outperforming classical ones.  

4. **Quantum Teleportation**  
   - Transfer an unknown quantum state from Alice to Bob using entanglement.  
   - Verify correctness via simulation and (optionally) real hardware execution.
