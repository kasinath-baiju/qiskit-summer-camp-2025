# Lab 3: The Power of 'Good Sampling' for Simulating a Chemistry Hamiltonian with SQD

Welcome to the third coding challenge of the **Qiskit Global Summer School 2025**.  
In this lab, we explore **quantum chemistry**, one of the most promising applications of quantum computing.  
You will simulate molecular systems using quantum algorithms, following workflows that quantum chemists typically use.
